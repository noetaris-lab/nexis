## What this plugin is

`nexis` is a Claude Code plugin (package scope `@noetaris`) inspired by the ZettelKasten method. Users run brainstorming or design sessions with Claude, then invoke `/nexis:ingest` to distill the conversation into atomic, linked, tagged notes stored in the project. On a brownfield codebase, `/nexis:survey` bootstraps the same store directly from the code (code as source of truth, docs as hints). Later, `/nexis:recall` performs agentic RAG over those notes to inject relevant context back into new conversations. `/nexis:wiki` projects the same notes into a human-readable onboarding wiki (overview → topics → detail) and keeps it in sync as notes evolve.

## Plugin structure

This is a Claude Code plugin — **not** an npm package. The entry point is `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

Skills live in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Agents live in `agents/<name>.md`. The `name` field in `plugin.json` is the skill namespace prefix, so all skills are invoked as `/nexis:<skill-name>` and agents are addressed as `nexis:<agent-name>`.

## Development workflow

### Test the plugin locally

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./nexis
```

After making changes to a skill or agent file, reload without restarting:

```
/reload-plugins
```

### Validate before distributing

```bash
claude plugin validate
```

## Note storage

Notes are written to `.nexis/` at the root of the **user's project** (not inside this plugin directory). This keeps notes co-located with the codebase so teams can commit and share them via git. Users can `.gitignore` the directory for personal notes or commit it to make notes a team asset.

```
<user-project>/
└── .nexis/
    ├── index.md            # Compact manifest — one row per note; loaded first on recall
    ├── notes/
    │   └── <id>.md         # One file per atomic note
    ├── wiki.manifest.md    # Machine state for wiki sync
    └── survey.manifest.md  # Machine state for codebase survey (unit plan + resume checkpoint)
```

A central aggregation layer (graph DB across multiple projects) is planned for a future version. The per-project format is designed to feed into it without changes.

## Note format

Each note is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. Notes are human-readable, git-diffable, and parseable by the retrieval agent without a separate parsing step.

```markdown
---
id: 7f3a1c
title: "CORS middleware must run before auth to handle preflight requests"
type: decision
tags: [auth, middleware, cors, security]
status: active
links:
  - id: a1b2c3
    rel: supersedes
  - id: 9d8e7f
    rel: relates_to
    note: "both deal with request pipeline ordering"
created: 2026-06-24T10:32:00Z
updated: 2026-06-24T10:32:00Z
---

The verifyJWT middleware was originally placed before the CORS handler, causing
unauthenticated preflight (OPTIONS) requests to be rejected before CORS headers
were set. Browsers require a 200 response with CORS headers on preflight — the
fix is to register the CORS middleware first in the chain.
```

**`type` values:** `concept` | `entity` | `decision` | `problem`

**`status` values:** `active` | `superseded` | `archived`

**`rel` (link relationship) types:**

| rel | meaning |
|---|---|
| `supersedes` | this note replaces the linked note (linked note gets a `superseded_by` back-link) |
| `superseded_by` | back-link written automatically on the older note |
| `extends` | adds detail to the linked note without replacing it (linked note gets an `extended_by` back-link) |
| `extended_by` | back-link written automatically on the extended note; carries a `note` recording what the extending note added/changed |
| `relates_to` | semantic neighbor — related but distinct concept |
| `contradicts` | records a disagreement or alternative decision |
| `depends-on` | this concept requires the target to function correctly |
| `implements` | this is the concrete realization of the target abstraction |
| `motivated-by` | this exists because of the target (decision or problem drove this note) |
| `decided-by` | this concept was settled by the target decision note |
| `part-of` | this note is a component or sub-concern of the target |

Add a `note` field to any link whose purpose would not be obvious from the `rel` type and the two note titles alone.

Back-links are written explicitly on both notes at ingest time so traversal is bidirectional without a full scan (`supersedes`↔`superseded_by`, `extends`↔`extended_by`).

**Content propagation:** a new note can leave other *active* notes asserting claims its content invalidated, in two ways. **Supersession:** superseding a note can leave referrers asserting claims derived from the overridden note. **Extension:** a note that `extends` another (leaving it `active`) may still change a surface fact the extended note embeds — a rename, a corrected value, a narrowed scope — so the extended note's body silently goes stale. In both cases ingest hands the affected notes to the `nexis:reconcile` sub-agent, which reviews each active note against the newer one and — only for those whose content is now inaccurate — revises the body (and title if needed), appends an in-body `*Updated: <ISO8601> — <reason>*` marker (stacked markers preserve history), bumps `updated`, and annotates the link with a `note` (for extensions, recording that the correction is applied inline so retrieval can skip the extending note). Purely-additive extensions and still-accurate referrers are left untouched. `status` never changes; links are not repointed. The same agent performs the retroactive review under `/nexis:doctor --fix-content`. See ingest Step 3.5 and `agents/reconcile.md`.

## Index format

`.nexis/index.md` is a compact manifest loaded first by the retrieval agent. It contains a `last_ingested` timestamp (used by ingest to scope the conversation) and one row per note.

```markdown
---
last_ingested: 2026-06-24T10:32:00Z
---

| id | title | type | tags | status | summary |
|----|-------|------|------|--------|---------|
| 7f3a1c | CORS middleware must run before auth | decision | auth,middleware,cors | active | verifyJWT before CORS breaks preflight; fix by reordering middleware |
```

## Retrieval architecture

Retrieval is split across two layers:

**`/nexis:retrieve` (skill with `context: fork`)** — runs the retrieval task in the `nexis:retrieval` Haiku sub-agent. The skill body is the task; the agent file body is the system prompt. Can be invoked directly by users for debugging.

**`retrieval.agent.md` (Haiku agent)** — does the actual work in four phases:

1. **Index scan** — reads `index.md`, applies status filter (`mode: current` drops superseded rows), applies optional type filter, selects up to 10 candidate IDs by semantic relevance
2. **Load candidates** — reads the full `.nexis/notes/<id>.md` for each candidate
3. **Graph traversal** — follows typed edges with a budget of 10 additional notes:
   - `extends`, `contradicts`, `motivated-by`, `decided-by` — always follow, budget-exempt
   - `supersedes` chains — follow only in `mode: full`
   - `extended_by` — budget-gated; its `note` may say the extending note's change is already reflected inline, in which case it is skipped outside `mode: full`
   - `relates_to`, `depends-on`, `implements`, `part-of` — budget-gated; relevance-assessed before loading
4. **Return** — structured list of notes (with `type` in headers) + relevance reasoning

**Model allocation:**

| component | model | reason |
|---|---|---|
| `/nexis:ingest` | Sonnet | judgment-heavy: atomicity, supersedes-vs-extends decisions, tag selection |
| `/nexis:recall` | Sonnet | synthesis and context injection require nuanced reasoning |
| `/nexis:retrieve` | Sonnet (shell only) | just reads a file and spawns the agent |
| `retrieval.agent.md` | Haiku | mechanical: index scan, structured graph traversal, well-defined output |
| `/nexis:wiki` | Session model — prefer **Opus** | orchestrator: taxonomy derivation is the most reasoning-heavy step (skills inherit the session model, so this is a recommendation, not a hard-coded field) |
| `wiki-scan.md` | Haiku | mechanical: index-shard tag stats and note→topic labeling |
| `wiki-page.md` | Sonnet (Opus for highest-quality docs) | human-facing narrative synthesis + Mermaid + fidelity self-check |
| `/nexis:wiki-translate` | Session model — prefer **Sonnet/Opus** | orchestrator: per-locale policy resolution, hash-based delta detection, delegation |
| `wiki-translate-page.md` | Sonnet (Opus for highest-quality docs) | native-quality bilingual rewriting + Mermaid identifier-preservation self-check — judgment-heavy, not mechanical |
| `scripts/bootstrap-starlight.mjs` | None (deterministic Node) | copies + placeholder-patches a bundled minimal Starlight scaffold; offline, no `npm create astro`, no `npm install`; also registers additional i18n locales (`--add-locale`) on an existing project |
| `scripts/mermaid-lint.mjs` | None (deterministic Node; loads the real `mermaid` parser when installed) | diagram validation is exact via the actual parser and free; no model should eyeball Mermaid syntax |
| `/nexis:doctor` | Session model — prefer **Sonnet/Opus** | orchestrator: runs the validator, then delegates Tier-3 propagation judgment |
| `scripts/doctor.mjs` | None (deterministic Node) | Tier-1/2 detection + safe repair; free and exact, scales to any note count |
| `reconcile.md` | Sonnet | judgment: is a note stale under a newer superseding/extending note, or under an archival? revise + stamp; shared by ingest + doctor + survey |
| `/nexis:survey` | Session model — prefer **Opus** | orchestrator: unit partitioning and cross-unit weave are the judgment-heavy steps; drift detection itself is deterministic (see `scripts/survey-topology.mjs` below) |
| `survey-analyst.md` | Sonnet | judgment: separating durable knowledge from code trivia; on a re-survey refresh, also judges whether its own unit's prior notes are stale enough to supersede; Haiku would flood the store |
| `scripts/survey-topology.mjs` | None (deterministic Node) | repo detection, branch/commit lock, and drift diffing are exact and free — no model ever constructs a git command for survey |

## Wiki architecture

`/nexis:wiki` projects the atomic note **graph** into a human-readable **hierarchy** (overview → topics → detail). The wiki is a **machine-owned derived view** — notes stay the sole source of truth; pages are regenerated freely and never hand-edited. One skill auto-detects **Build** (no manifest) vs **Sync** (manifest exists); `--rebuild` forces a full rebuild.

**Orchestrator (`/nexis:wiki`, Sonnet/Opus)** — never loads note bodies in bulk. Before taxonomy work, for `target: starlight` it runs `scripts/bootstrap-starlight.mjs` to ensure the output root is a valid Starlight project — scaffolding one from a bundled template on first use, or refusing the whole run if the root is a conflicting non-Starlight directory. It then reasons over `index.md` rows, derives the topic taxonomy (iterative hypothesize → split/merge → freeze slugs), plans pages, delegates, reconciles, writes the landing page (with an italicized generated-at line) + manifest. For `target: starlight` it also rewrites `nexis-sidebar.mjs` (Step B7/S6) so the left nav uses the wiki's own reading order and Title-Case section labels rather than Starlight's alphabetized, lower-case-slug file-tree autogeneration.

**`wiki-scan.md` (Haiku)** — index-shard worker, active only above the shard threshold (default 1500 notes). `survey` mode returns tag stats/co-occurrence for taxonomy; `assign` mode labels notes given frozen topic definitions (tags plus a one-line theme description each), falling back to title/summary thematic fit when tag overlap is weak or tied. Keeps the full index out of the orchestrator's context at scale.

**`wiki-page.md` (Sonnet)** — one per topic, spawned in parallel. Loads only its topic's notes, plans that topic's own narrative shape rather than filling in a fixed heading template, weaves decision/problem *reasoning* and lineage (`supersedes`/`motivated-by`/`contradicts`/`decided-by`) into the main prose so the page explains not just what and how but *why*, writes it up (Mermaid diagrams — following the agent's Mermaid-must-parse authoring rules — fenced code, no visible citations, portable Markdown by default / Starlight syntax when `target: starlight`), **self-checks every claim against the notes**, and returns a compact result manifest (never the page text). Oversized topics become mini-sections.

**Mermaid QA gate (`scripts/mermaid-lint.mjs`)** — because `astro-mermaid` renders diagrams client-side, `astro build` never fails on a malformed diagram; it just ships an error box. So after page generation the orchestrator runs this validator (Step B5.5/S5.5). It uses the **real `mermaid` parser** when `mermaid`+`jsdom` resolve from the target project's `node_modules` (authoritative), falling back to narrow, parser-verified **structural checks** before `npm install`. `--fix` auto-corrects the safe, empirically-confirmed failure classes (unquoted `()` in labels, reserved-word ids like `end`/`loop`, `;` in sequence text) — each fix must actually parse before it is written. Anything left invalid bounces that page back to a re-spawned `wiki-page` agent. The template ships `jsdom` as a devDependency so the authoritative path is available after install.

Adaptive depth: the orchestrator reasons about navigability rather than checking topic count against a fixed cap — flat (home + topic pages) while the topic set still reads as one scannable list, ~12 topics being a rough (not hard) point where that stops holding; past it, a section tier (home → section → topic) grouped by how topics relate. The landing page always stays a short, orienting entry point — the exhaustive per-topic table and any relationship diagram are included there only in flat depth where they stay small; once sectioned, the landing page carries just a section list and the full table moves to a dedicated `all-topics.md`, and no whole-graph diagram is attempted (it stops being legible at that scale). Sync is conservative — it appends new topics / splits oversized ones / adjusts the section tier and preserves existing slugs, emitting a drift hint to run `--rebuild` rather than silently re-clustering.

## Wiki storage

Human content is written to a **configurable content root** (precedence: inline `--out` > a path declared in the loaded project context, e.g. CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md > the manifest's recorded root on sync > default `.nexis/wiki/`). For `target: starlight`, `output_root` names the bootstrapped Astro project root, but pages actually land under `output_root/src/content/docs/` (Starlight's fixed file-based-routing path) — the manifest's `page` values include that prefix. Machine state lives at `.nexis/wiki.manifest.md` regardless, so a doc site (e.g. Starlight) never renders it. The manifest records `output_root`, `target`, `last_synced`, `shard_threshold`, `depth` (`flat`/`sectioned`), the topic table (with cached summaries, which double as each topic's theme description for reuse in sync-time assignment), and the note→page map with per-row fingerprints. Fingerprints (`status|title|tags|summary` hash) drive cheap index-vs-manifest delta detection on sync — added / changed / removed — without reading any note bodies. Provenance lives only in the manifest note map; pages carry no visible note references.

For `target: starlight`, every bootstrapped project is **i18n-ready from scaffold time** via a machine-owned `nexis-locales.mjs` (sibling to `astro.config.mjs`, in the same never-hand-edit spirit as `nexis-sidebar.mjs`), wired into `starlight({...})` as `defaultLocale`/`locales`. The default locale is registered under Starlight's reserved `root` key, so its pages keep their existing unprefixed paths forever — adding a language later (via `/nexis:wiki-translate`) never requires moving or restructuring any existing content.

## Translation architecture

`/nexis:wiki-translate --lang <code>` projects the built Starlight wiki into another language — a further derived view of the wiki's own derived view, not of the notes. It targets `target: starlight` only (the `plain` target has no i18n mechanism to hook into) and translates one locale per invocation.

**Locale registration (`scripts/bootstrap-starlight.mjs --add-locale`)** — the same deterministic, offline script used for the initial Starlight scaffold also owns registering additional locales on an already-bootstrapped project. It rewrites `nexis-locales.mjs` wholesale (idempotent — adding an already-registered locale is a no-op) and, exactly once per project, retrofits `defaultLocale`/`locales` wiring into an `astro.config.mjs` that predates this feature. It never repeatedly edits `astro.config.mjs` on every call — only the machine-owned locale-registry file, once the initial wiring exists.

**State (`.nexis/wiki-translate.manifest.md`)** — a sibling to `.nexis/wiki.manifest.md` and `.nexis/survey.manifest.md`, exclusively owned by this skill (the base `/nexis:wiki` never reads or writes it). A `## Locales` table records each translated locale's resolved terminology/diagram policy and `last_synced`; a `## Translations` table records, per `slug` × `locale`, the translated file's path, a content hash of the *source* page it was translated from, and `translated_at`. Delta detection on sync hashes the current source pages (enumerated from `.nexis/wiki.manifest.md`'s Topics table plus synthetic landing/section entries, never a raw directory walk — the content root also holds other locales once i18n is live) and diffs by `slug`, so only pages that actually changed are retranslated; a page whose section moved (slug stable, path changed) is treated as delete-then-retranslate, not silently orphaned.

**Policy prompting** — the first time a locale is translated, the skill asks (once, in the conversation, independently for each dimension unless overridden by `--terms`/`--diagrams`) how to handle **terminology** (translate / keep-with-gloss / keep-original) and **diagrams** (translate Mermaid labels / keep original). The answer is persisted per locale and reused on every later sync without re-prompting; changing it later forces a full retranslation of that locale for consistency.

**`wiki-translate-page.md` (Sonnet)** — one per changed page, spawned in parallel, mirroring `wiki-page.md`'s load → write → self-check → compact-manifest shape. Framed explicitly as a bilingual technical writer producing a natural, native-register translation rather than a literal rendering. Applies the locale's terminology/diagram policy, translates frontmatter `title`/`description` alongside the body, and — for diagrams under `translate` policy — translates only label/message text, never node/participant/subgraph ids, with a self-check that identifier sets are unchanged (the shared Mermaid QA gate, `scripts/mermaid-lint.mjs`, only verifies *parse* validity, not this semantic-preservation rule, so it's the sub-agent's own responsibility).

**Scope cut (v1)**: `nexis-sidebar.mjs` nav labels and `Pagination.astro` section captions stay in the default language — Starlight's built-in i18n fallback already renders default-locale chrome automatically when no per-locale `translations` are configured, so the site works, it just isn't fully localized navigation.

## Survey architecture

`/nexis:survey` bootstraps the note store from a **brownfield codebase** — the code-sourced counterpart to conversation ingest — and, on a later invocation, **incrementally re-surveys** it by diffing against the commit last surveyed. It is checkpointed (resumable if interrupted) on first run, and drift-scoped (re-analyzes only what changed) on later runs; `--rebuild` always starts fresh. Two governing principles: **code is the source of truth** (docs/READMEs are hints, verified against code; doc-vs-code contradictions become `problem` notes), and **selectivity over coverage** (durable knowledge — architecture, invariants, evidenced decisions, risks — not per-file documentation).

Because drift detection is git-based, the skill locks each repo to a branch at first survey and **refuses rather than guesses** whenever that lineage can't be trusted: git not installed, no repo found anywhere in the workspace, a legacy pre-re-survey manifest, a branch switch, rewritten history, or a dirty working tree. In a multi-repo workspace (an umbrella folder containing several independently-versioned sibling repos, each a unit's `repo_path`), any single repo failing a gate refuses the whole run.

**Orchestrator (`/nexis:survey`, prefer Opus)** — never reads source bodies. Runs a deterministic shell **inventory** (git ls-files, package manifests, churn hotspots), **partitions** the repo into analysis units (≤ ~60 files, foundation vs leaf), writes one inventory-grounded system entity note, fans out analysts, then **weaves**: resolves cross-unit `depends-on` links (analysts report deps by unit *slug*; orchestrator maps slug→entity-id via the manifest), dedups from manifests, and is the **single writer of `index.md`**. Ends with a `doctor.mjs` QA gate. It never writes `last_ingested` (that field scopes conversation ingest; clobbering it would make the next `/nexis:ingest` skip history).

**`survey-analyst.md` (Sonnet)** — one per unit, wave-ordered (≤5 concurrent): **foundation units first**, later waves briefed with the accumulated note manifest (one line per note) so shared concepts are linked, not duplicated — this is how the mental model builds incrementally without any context holding the whole project. Each analyst recons its unit's structure, reads selectively under a depth budget (`quick` ≤8 files / `standard` ≤20 / `deep` ≤40), verifies doc claims in code, applies the ingest atomicity bar plus a per-unit note cap (trivia guard), writes notes directly, and returns a compact manifest. It normally only *adds* notes — never supersedes or edits another unit's or ingest's; code that contradicts a prior note not its own yields a `contradicts` note (typed `problem` when the code appears to *violate* a decision/invariant, else a plain code-reality note), because reading code can't tell a stale note from buggy code and must not adjudicate. The one exception: on a **re-survey refresh** of a unit it already analyzed, it may supersede its *own* prior descriptive (`concept`/`entity`) notes outright, and its own prior `decision`/`problem` notes only with git-log evidence of an explicit reversal — same non-adjudication logic, narrowed to what it can safely judge about its own earlier output. Decision notes never fabricate rationale — git log evidence or an explicit "rationale not recorded". Evidence is cited as file paths, never line numbers.

**`scripts/survey-topology.mjs` (deterministic Node, no model)** — the sole source of git truth for survey. Detects repos (workspace root + depth-1 children, both plain-repo and submodule/gitlink forms), reports each one's branch/commit/dirty state, and — given the manifest's Repos table — classifies each as `unchanged | changed | new | removed | branch_mismatch | dirty | history_rewritten`, plus the changed-file list for `changed` repos. The orchestrator only ever reads this JSON; it never constructs a git command itself.

**State (`.nexis/survey.manifest.md`)** — a **Repos** table (`repo_path | branch | last_surveyed_commit`, one row per detected repo — a single-repo project is just this table's one-row case) plus the **Units** table (`slug | paths | kind | status | entity_id | role | repo_path | note_ids`) with per-unit `status` (`pending | done | archived`) checkpointed each wave, so an interrupted survey resumes from pending units; `entity_id` lets the weave resolve cross-unit deps on resume without re-reading notes, and `note_ids` lets a re-survey brief an analyst with its own prior output and drives the archival sweep when a unit's code disappears. Re-survey diffs the current git state against the Repos table (via `survey-topology.mjs`) to scope re-analysis to what changed, and refuses outright — rather than guessing — on any unsafe git state.

## Doctor architecture

`/nexis:doctor` is the health check / linter / `fsck` for the note store. It splits work into a deterministic layer and a judgment layer so it stays cheap at any scale — the cheap pass filters, so the model only ever sees flagged candidates, never the whole store.

**`scripts/doctor.mjs` (deterministic Node, no model)** — reads every note's frontmatter + `index.md` and emits a JSON report. Detects and (with `--fix`) safely repairs:
- **Tier 1 — schema**: missing required fields, `type`/`status` vocab, tag count/format, ISO8601 timestamps, `updated >= created`, `id`↔filename, duplicate ids.
- **Tier 2 — graph/index**: `rel` vocab, dangling/self links, `decided-by`→`decision` and `motivated-by`→`decision|problem` target types, supersede back-link symmetry, `status`/`superseded_by` consistency, supersede cycles, and index↔notes drift.
- **Tier 3 — pre-filter only**: `propagation_candidates[]` — active notes whose `updated` predates a newer note that changed their meaning, each tagged with a `kind`: `supersession` (active referrers of a superseded note) or `extension` (a note later extended by a newer note that may have changed a surface fact it embeds). Keyed off the link graph, not the possibly-wrong `status` field. The script never edits these.

Safe `--fix` repairs are non-destructive: add missing back-links, correct `status`/`superseded_by`, normalize tags, reconcile the index (existing summaries preserved). It never deletes notes, edits bodies, removes links, or renames files — those are reported as **manual** TODOs.

**`/nexis:doctor` (orchestrator, Sonnet/Opus)** — runs the validator, presents grouped findings, applies safe repairs under `--fix`, and under `--fix-content` performs the Tier-3 propagation review by grouping `propagation_candidates[]` (supersession groups per superseded note, extension groups per extending note) and delegating each group to a `nexis:reconcile` agent (spawned in parallel). Report-only by default. Delegation keeps candidate bodies out of the doctor context, so the retroactive backfill scales regardless of how much debt a legacy store holds; the same agent backs ingest's Step 3.5.

## Key conventions

- **Skill frontmatter**: every `SKILL.md` must have a `description:` field so Claude knows when to invoke the skill automatically.
- **`$ARGUMENTS`**: use this placeholder in `SKILL.md` to capture text the user passes after the skill name (e.g. `/nexis:recall auth middleware decision`).
- **Retrieval modes**: `current` (default — active notes only) and `full` (includes superseded notes for historical queries). Recall auto-detects historical queries from keyword patterns but accepts an explicit `--mode` override; ingest always uses `full` during reconciliation.
- **Type filter**: `/nexis:retrieve` accepts `--type <concept|entity|decision|problem>` to restrict results. The retrieval agent applies the type filter in Phase 1 before relevance matching.
- **Recall query derivation**: if `/nexis:recall` is invoked with no arguments, it derives the query from the most recent user message in the conversation.
- **Ingest is autonomous**: ingest writes notes without prompting for user confirmation. The completion report tells the user what was created, superseded, or skipped.
- **Wiki is autonomous**: `/nexis:wiki` builds or syncs without prompting; the completion report states what was created, updated, or reported as unassigned. It is `disable-model-invocation: true` (deliberate write op, like ingest).
- **Survey is autonomous, checkpointed, and now incrementally re-surveyable**: `/nexis:survey` runs without prompting (`disable-model-invocation: true`); `--plan` previews the plan without writing, `--paths` scopes a trial run, `--depth quick|standard|deep` bounds per-unit cost, `--rebuild` discards any prior checkpoint and starts fresh on the current git state. Auto-detects **Build** (no manifest) / **Resume** (units still `pending`) / **Re-survey** (all `done`, git state has drifted since `last_surveyed_commit`) from `survey.manifest.md` plus a `survey-topology.mjs` scan. It **refuses** rather than guesses on: git not installed, no repo found, a legacy pre-re-survey manifest, a branch switch, rewritten history, or a dirty tree (any one repo failing a gate refuses the whole run in a multi-repo workspace). Survey only adds notes on a fresh Build; on re-survey an analyst may additionally supersede its *own* unit's stale prior notes (never another unit's or ingest's) and archive units whose code is gone, propagating both via `nexis:reconcile`. Analysts never write `index.md`; the orchestrator is the single index writer and never touches `last_ingested`.
- **Wiki path/target override**: `/nexis:wiki` accepts `--out <path>`, `--target <plain|starlight>`, and `--rebuild`. Inline flags override any path/target declared in the loaded project context. For `--target starlight`, the skill first runs `scripts/bootstrap-starlight.mjs` (deterministic, offline, no `npm create astro`/`npm install`) to scaffold a minimal Starlight project at `--out` if one isn't already there; a conflicting non-Starlight directory at `--out` halts the whole run rather than being overwritten.
- **Wiki translation**: `/nexis:wiki-translate --lang <code> [--label "<Native name>"] [--terms translate|gloss|keep] [--diagrams translate|keep] [--rebuild-locale]` translates the built wiki into another language; `target: starlight` only, one locale per invocation. The terminology/diagram policy is asked once per new locale (independently per dimension, unless the flags are given) and persisted in `.nexis/wiki-translate.manifest.md`, its own manifest file that `/nexis:wiki` never touches.
- **Immutability assumption**: wiki sync detects deltas from `index.md` because notes change only via new superseding notes + status patches, never in-place body edits. In-place body edits are out of scope; `--rebuild` covers them.
- **Doctor is graduated and safe-by-default**: `/nexis:doctor` is report-only with no flags; `--fix` applies only safe deterministic Tier-1/2 repairs; `--fix-content` additionally revises stale referrers (Tier-3). It never deletes notes or history — destructive/judgment fixes are reported, not applied. It is `disable-model-invocation: true`. The deterministic layer is a shipped script (`scripts/doctor.mjs`) run via `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/doctor.mjs"`, not per-note model work, so it scales to any store size.
