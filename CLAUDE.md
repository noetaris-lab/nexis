## What this plugin is

`nexis` is a Claude Code plugin (package scope `@noetaris`) inspired by the ZettelKasten method. Users run brainstorming or design sessions with Claude, then invoke `/nexis:ingest` to distill the conversation into atomic, linked, tagged notes stored in the project. Later, `/nexis:recall` performs agentic RAG over those notes to inject relevant context back into new conversations. `/nexis:wiki` projects the same notes into a human-readable onboarding wiki (overview → topics → detail) and keeps it in sync as notes evolve.

## Plugin structure

This is a Claude Code plugin — **not** an npm package. The entry point is `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

```

Skills live in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Agents live in `agents/<name>.md`. The `name` field in `plugin.json` is the skill namespace prefix, so all skills are invoked as `/nexis:<skill-name>` and agents are addressed as `nexis:<agent-name>`.

## Development workflow

### Test the plugin locally

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./nexis
```

After making changes to a skill or agent file, reload without restarting:

```
/reload-plugins
```

### Validate before distributing

```bash
claude plugin validate
```

## Note storage

Notes are written to `.nexis/` at the root of the **user's project** (not inside this plugin directory). This keeps notes co-located with the codebase so teams can commit and share them via git. Users can `.gitignore` the directory for personal notes or commit it to make notes a team asset.

```
<user-project>/
└── .nexis/
    ├── index.md          # Compact manifest — one row per note; loaded first on recall
    └── notes/
        └── <id>.md       # One file per atomic note
```

A central aggregation layer (graph DB across multiple projects) is planned for a future version. The per-project format is designed to feed into it without changes.

## Note format

Each note is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. Notes are human-readable, git-diffable, and parseable by the retrieval agent without a separate parsing step.

```markdown
---
id: 7f3a1c
title: "CORS middleware must run before auth to handle preflight requests"
type: decision
tags: [auth, middleware, cors, security]
status: active
links:
  - id: a1b2c3
    rel: supersedes
  - id: 9d8e7f
    rel: relates_to
    note: "both deal with request pipeline ordering"

The verifyJWT middleware was originally placed before the CORS handler, causing
unauthenticated preflight (OPTIONS) requests to be rejected before CORS headers
were set. Browsers require a 200 response with CORS headers on preflight — the
fix is to register the CORS middleware first in the chain.
```

**`type` values:** `concept` | `entity` | `decision` | `problem`

**`status` values:** `active` | `superseded` | `archived`

**`rel` (link relationship) types:**

| rel | meaning |
|---|---|
| `supersedes` | this note replaces the linked note (linked note gets a `superseded_by` back-link) |
| `superseded_by` | back-link written automatically on the older note |
| `extends` | adds detail to the linked note without replacing it |
| `relates_to` | semantic neighbor — related but distinct concept |
| `contradicts` | records a disagreement or alternative decision |
| `depends-on` | this concept requires the target to function correctly |
| `implements` | this is the concrete realization of the target abstraction |
| `motivated-by` | this exists because of the target (decision or problem drove this note) |
| `decided-by` | this concept was settled by the target decision note |
| `part-of` | this note is a component or sub-concern of the target |

Add a `note` field to any link whose purpose would not be obvious from the `rel` type and the two note titles alone.

Back-links are written explicitly on both notes at ingest time so traversal is bidirectional without a full scan.

**Supersession propagation:** superseding a note can leave other *active* notes asserting claims derived from the overridden note. After patching a superseded note, ingest greps `.nexis/notes/` for referrers and hands them to the `nexis:reconcile` sub-agent, which reviews each active referrer against the superseding note and — only for those whose content is now inaccurate — revises the body, appends an in-body `*Updated: <ISO8601> — <reason>*` marker (stacked markers preserve history), bumps `updated`, and annotates the referrer's link with a `note` recording that the target was superseded. Referrers that are still accurate are left untouched. Referrer `status` never changes; links are not repointed. The same agent performs the retroactive review under `/nexis:doctor --fix-content`. See ingest Step 3.5 and `agents/reconcile.md`.

## Index format

`.nexis/index.md` is a compact manifest loaded first by the retrieval agent. It contains a `last_ingested` timestamp (used by ingest to scope the conversation) and one row per note.

```markdown
---
last_ingested: 2026-06-24T10:32:00Z
---

| id | title | type | tags | status | summary |
|----|-------|------|------|--------|---------|
| 7f3a1c | CORS middleware must run before auth | decision | auth,middleware,cors | active | verifyJWT before CORS breaks preflight; fix by reordering middleware |
```

## Retrieval architecture

Retrieval is split across two layers:

**`/nexis:retrieve` (skill with `context: fork`)** — runs the retrieval task in the `nexis:retrieval` Haiku sub-agent. The skill body is the task; the agent file body is the system prompt. Can be invoked directly by users for debugging.

**`retrieval.agent.md` (Haiku agent)** — does the actual work in four phases:

1. **Index scan** — reads `index.md`, applies status filter (`mode: current` drops superseded rows), applies optional type filter, selects up to 10 candidate IDs by semantic relevance
2. **Load candidates** — reads the full `.nexis/notes/<id>.md` for each candidate
3. **Graph traversal** — follows typed edges with a budget of 10 additional notes:
   - `extends`, `contradicts`, `motivated-by`, `decided-by` — always follow, budget-exempt
   - `supersedes` chains — follow only in `mode: full`
   - `relates_to`, `depends-on`, `implements`, `part-of` — budget-gated; relevance-assessed before loading
4. **Return** — structured list of notes (with `type` in headers) + relevance reasoning

**Model allocation:**

| component | model | reason |
|---|---|---|
| `/nexis:ingest` | Sonnet | judgment-heavy: atomicity, supersedes-vs-extends decisions, tag selection |
| `/nexis:recall` | Sonnet | synthesis and context injection require nuanced reasoning |
| `/nexis:retrieve` | Sonnet (shell only) | just reads a file and spawns the agent |
| `retrieval.agent.md` | Haiku | mechanical: index scan, structured graph traversal, well-defined output |
| `/nexis:wiki` | Session model — prefer **Opus** | orchestrator: taxonomy derivation is the most reasoning-heavy step (skills inherit the session model, so this is a recommendation, not a hard-coded field) |
| `wiki-scan.md` | Haiku | mechanical: index-shard tag stats and note→topic labeling |
| `wiki-page.md` | Sonnet (Opus for highest-quality docs) | human-facing narrative synthesis + Mermaid + fidelity self-check |
| `/nexis:doctor` | Session model — prefer **Sonnet/Opus** | orchestrator: runs the validator, then delegates Tier-3 propagation judgment |
| `scripts/doctor.mjs` | None (deterministic Node) | Tier-1/2 detection + safe repair; free and exact, scales to any note count |
| `reconcile.md` | Sonnet | judgment: is a referrer stale under the superseding note? revise + stamp; shared by ingest + doctor |

## Wiki architecture

`/nexis:wiki` projects the atomic note **graph** into a human-readable **hierarchy** (overview → topics → detail). The wiki is a **machine-owned derived view** — notes stay the sole source of truth; pages are regenerated freely and never hand-edited. One skill auto-detects **Build** (no manifest) vs **Sync** (manifest exists); `--rebuild` forces a full rebuild.

**Orchestrator (`/nexis:wiki`, Sonnet/Opus)** — never loads note bodies in bulk. It reasons over `index.md` rows, derives the topic taxonomy (iterative hypothesize → split/merge → freeze slugs), plans pages, delegates, reconciles, writes the landing page + manifest.

**`wiki-scan.md` (Haiku)** — index-shard worker, active only above the shard threshold (default 1500 notes). `survey` mode returns tag stats/co-occurrence for taxonomy; `assign` mode labels notes given frozen topic definitions. Keeps the full index out of the orchestrator's context at scale.

**`wiki-page.md` (Sonnet)** — one per topic, spawned in parallel. Loads only its topic's notes, writes a human-friendly page (Mermaid diagrams, fenced code, no visible citations, portable Markdown by default / Starlight syntax when `target: starlight`), **self-checks every claim against the notes**, and returns a compact result manifest (never the page text). Oversized topics become mini-sections.

Adaptive depth: flat (home + topic pages) up to ~12 topics, then a section tier (home → section → topic). Sync is conservative — it appends new topics / splits oversized ones / adjusts the section tier and preserves existing slugs, emitting a drift hint to run `--rebuild` rather than silently re-clustering.

## Wiki storage

Human content is written to a **configurable content root** (precedence: inline `--out` > a path declared in the loaded project context, e.g. CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md > the manifest's recorded root on sync > default `.nexis/wiki/`). Machine state lives at `.nexis/wiki.manifest.md` regardless, so a doc site (e.g. Starlight) never renders it. The manifest records `output_root`, `target`, `last_synced`, `shard_threshold`, the topic table (with cached summaries), and the note→page map with per-row fingerprints. Fingerprints (`status|title|tags|summary` hash) drive cheap index-vs-manifest delta detection on sync — added / changed / removed — without reading any note bodies. Provenance lives only in the manifest note map; pages carry no visible note references.

## Doctor architecture

`/nexis:doctor` is the health check / linter / `fsck` for the note store. It splits work into a deterministic layer and a judgment layer so it stays cheap at any scale — the cheap pass filters, so the model only ever sees flagged candidates, never the whole store.

**`scripts/doctor.mjs` (deterministic Node, no model)** — reads every note's frontmatter + `index.md` and emits a JSON report. Detects and (with `--fix`) safely repairs:
- **Tier 1 — schema**: missing required fields, `type`/`status` vocab, tag count/format, ISO8601 timestamps, `updated >= created`, `id`↔filename, duplicate ids.
- **Tier 2 — graph/index**: `rel` vocab, dangling/self links, `decided-by`→`decision` and `motivated-by`→`decision|problem` target types, supersede back-link symmetry, `status`/`superseded_by` consistency, supersede cycles, and index↔notes drift.
- **Tier 3 — pre-filter only**: `propagation_candidates[]` — active referrers of a superseded note whose `updated` predates the override (keyed off the link graph, not the possibly-wrong `status` field). The script never edits these.

Safe `--fix` repairs are non-destructive: add missing back-links, correct `status`/`superseded_by`, normalize tags, reconcile the index (existing summaries preserved). It never deletes notes, edits bodies, removes links, or renames files — those are reported as **manual** TODOs.

**`/nexis:doctor` (orchestrator, Sonnet/Opus)** — runs the validator, presents grouped findings, applies safe repairs under `--fix`, and under `--fix-content` performs the Tier-3 propagation review by grouping `propagation_candidates[]` per superseded note and delegating each group to a `nexis:reconcile` agent (spawned in parallel). Report-only by default. Delegation keeps candidate bodies out of the doctor context, so the retroactive backfill scales regardless of how much debt a legacy store holds; the same agent backs ingest's Step 3.5.

## Key conventions

- **Skill frontmatter**: every `SKILL.md` must have a `description:` field so Claude knows when to invoke the skill automatically.
- **`$ARGUMENTS`**: use this placeholder in `SKILL.md` to capture text the user passes after the skill name (e.g. `/nexis:recall auth middleware decision`).
- **Retrieval modes**: `current` (default — active notes only) and `full` (includes superseded notes for historical queries). Recall auto-detects historical queries from keyword patterns but accepts an explicit `--mode` override; ingest always uses `full` during reconciliation.
- **Type filter**: `/nexis:retrieve` accepts `--type <concept|entity|decision|problem>` to restrict results. The retrieval agent applies the type filter in Phase 1 before relevance matching.
- **Recall query derivation**: if `/nexis:recall` is invoked with no arguments, it derives the query from the most recent user message in the conversation.
- **Ingest is autonomous**: ingest writes notes without prompting for user confirmation. The completion report tells the user what was created, superseded, or skipped.
- **Wiki is autonomous**: `/nexis:wiki` builds or syncs without prompting; the completion report states what was created, updated, or reported as unassigned. It is `disable-model-invocation: true` (deliberate write op, like ingest).
- **Wiki path/target override**: `/nexis:wiki` accepts `--out <path>`, `--target <plain|starlight>`, and `--rebuild`. Inline flags override any path/target declared in the loaded project context.
- **Immutability assumption**: wiki sync detects deltas from `index.md` because notes change only via new superseding notes + status patches, never in-place body edits. In-place body edits are out of scope; `--rebuild` covers them.
- **Doctor is graduated and safe-by-default**: `/nexis:doctor` is report-only with no flags; `--fix` applies only safe deterministic Tier-1/2 repairs; `--fix-content` additionally revises stale referrers (Tier-3). It never deletes notes or history — destructive/judgment fixes are reported, not applied. It is `disable-model-invocation: true`. The deterministic layer is a shipped script (`scripts/doctor.mjs`) run via `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/doctor.mjs"`, not per-note model work, so it scales to any store size.
